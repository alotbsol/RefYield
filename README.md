# RefYield
Model of German reference yield model and german wind auctions

Main file
- when run Tkinter window pops up which can control the model
- includes buttuns and entry fields which are displayed on screen

Settings
- variables and dictionaries for storages are all here

Fun
- here are some usefull functions which are used all around the place

gen
- that is probably the most important, it is used to generate new projects based on probability density functions
- it calculates different compensation mechanisms scenarios
- it saves data from one round and multiple rounds with similar conditions

Screen
- just classess of objects which are displayed

Scenarios
- step by step process of the actual models
- currently there are 7 scenarios which can be played, from single round and multiple rounds where parameters can be mostly adjusted in tkinter windo
- further more complex simulations which includes changes of probability density functions and different supply demand etc, these need to be hardcoded here, cannot be changed when program is running
- also scenario which correspond to german auction is included


Export
- this exporter puts results of the simulation into excel file
